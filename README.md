# Python File Handling

This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating common file operations in Python: reading a file with error handling, and writing/appending data to a file.


## 1. Read a File and Handle Errors

This program performs the following tasks:

* Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
* Prints its content line by line to the console.
* Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist, displaying an appropriate error message instead of crashing.


## 2. Write and Append Data to a File

This program allows you to:

* Take user input and write it to a file named `output.txt`. This will overwrite any existing content in the file.
* Append additional user input to the same file, preserving the existing data.
* Read and display the final content of `output.txt` after writing and appending operations.


## Usage

* For the **Read a File** program, ensure `sample.txt` exists in the working directory before running the script.
* For the **Write and Append Data** program, simply run the script and follow the prompts to enter and append data.
